Context: Integration of tmux and Emacs for enhanced Scheme development workflow

Considerations:
- Chose to update existing mccarthy-lisp-explorer.el rather than create a new file to maintain consistency
- Added project variables to Makefile for better maintainability
- Included comprehensive Emacs packages (Geiser, Paredit, Rainbow-delimiters) for optimal Scheme editing
- Tmux session management allows persistent development environment across sessions

Technical decisions:
- Used PROJECT_NAME and PROJECT_ROOT variables for flexibility
- Emacs launched with -Q flag to avoid user config conflicts, then loads project-specific config
- Added error handling for existing tmux sessions
- Configured TRAMP for potential remote development needs

Issues addressed:
- Provided seamless integration between tmux, Emacs, and Guile3
- Ensured proper load paths for project source files
- Added structured editing support with Paredit for S-expression manipulation

Timing: ~5 minutes implementation
