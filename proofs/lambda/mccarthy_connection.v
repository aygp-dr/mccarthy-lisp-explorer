(** 
 * This module explores the connections between our Coq formalizations
 * and John McCarthy's Lisp. McCarthy's 1960 paper "Recursive Functions of 
 * Symbolic Expressions and Their Computation by Machine, Part I" introduced
 * Lisp with concepts that we've formalized here.
 *)

(** 
 * Key connections:
 *
 * 1. Recursive function definitions: McCarthy's Lisp introduced a way to define
 *    recursive functions in a programming language. Our Fixpoint definitions in
 *    Coq, like factorial and fibonacci, follow the same recursive structure.
 *
 * 2. Conditional expressions: McCarthy's cond expressions correspond to our
 *    match statements and if-then-else expressions in Coq.
 *
 * 3. Lambda calculus: McCarthy was influenced by Church's lambda calculus,
 *    which we've formalized in our lambda_basics module.
 *
 * 4. Function application: Function application in Lisp and in our formalized
 *    lambda calculus follow similar patterns.
 *
 * 5. Recursion via Y combinator: While not explicit in early Lisp, the
 *    Y combinator we've formalized provides the theoretical foundation for
 *    how recursion works in functional languages.
 *)

(** 
 * Example: McCarthy's factorial in pseudo-Lisp:
 *
 * (define factorial
 *   (lambda (n)
 *     (if (= n 0)
 *         1
 *         (* n (factorial (- n 1))))))
 *
 * Corresponds to our Coq definition:
 * 
 * Fixpoint factorial (n : nat) :=
 *   match n with
 *   | 0 => 1
 *   | S n' => n * factorial n'
 *   end.
 *)

(** 
 * Example: The Y combinator in Lisp would look something like:
 *
 * (define Y
 *   (lambda (f)
 *     ((lambda (x) (f (lambda (y) ((x x) y))))
 *      (lambda (x) (f (lambda (y) ((x x) y)))))))
 *
 * Which corresponds to our Y_combinator definition.
 *)

(** 
 * These formalizations provide a rigorous way to understand and verify
 * the concepts that McCarthy introduced in his groundbreaking work on Lisp.
