(** Y Combinator in Coq *)

Require Import McCarthyLispProofs.lambda.lambda_basics.

(**
 * This module explores the Y combinator, which enables recursion in the
 * pure lambda calculus. McCarthy's Lisp was influenced by these concepts.
 *)

(** Y combinator in our term representation *)
Definition Y_combinator :=
  Abs 0 (
    App 
      (Abs 1 (App (Var 0) (App (Var 1) (Var 1))))
      (Abs 1 (App (Var 0) (App (Var 1) (Var 1))))
  ).

(** We can represent a factorial-like function that takes a self-reference *)
Definition factorial_step :=
  Abs 0 (  (* self-reference *)
    Abs 1 (  (* input n *)
      App 
        (App 
          (App (Var 1) (Var 1))  (* if n = 0 *)
          (Abs 2 (Var 1)))       (* then 1 *)
        (Abs 2                    (* else n * f(n-1) *)
          (App 
            (App 
              (Church_nat 1)      (* Multiplication operation *)
              (Var 1)             (* n *)
            )
            (App 
              (Var 0)             (* self-reference *)
              (App                (* n-1 *)
                (Church_nat 1)    (* Subtraction operation *)
                (Var 1)           (* n *)
              )
            )
          )
        )
    )
  ).

(** Y combinator applied to factorial_step gives us a recursive factorial *)
Definition factorial := App Y_combinator factorial_step.

(** 
 * We could prove various properties about this factorial implementation,
 * but the proofs would be quite complex due to the encoding of operations
 * as lambda terms. For simplicity, we'll just define the basic structure.
 *)

(** 
 * This demonstrates how recursion can be achieved in a pure lambda calculus
 * setting, which was a key insight that influenced McCarthy's development of Lisp.
