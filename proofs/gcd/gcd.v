(** Definition and properties of the Greatest Common Divisor *)

(** First, we need some definitions about divisibility *)
Definition divides (a b : nat) : Prop := exists k, b = k * a.

Notation "a | b" := (divides a b) (at level 70, no associativity).

(** Euclidean algorithm for GCD - this recursive approach is similar to
    McCarthy's conditional expressions in Lisp *)
Fixpoint gcd (a b : nat) : nat :=
  match b with
  | 0 => match a with
         | 0 => 0  (* Special case: gcd(0,0) = 0 *)
         | _ => a
         end
  | _ => gcd b (a mod b)
  end.

(** Let's test the implementation with some examples *)
Example gcd_17_5 : gcd 17 5 = 1.
Proof. reflexivity. Qed.

Example gcd_12_18 : gcd 12 18 = 6.
Proof. reflexivity. Qed.

(** GCD is commutative *)
Theorem gcd_comm : forall a b : nat,
  gcd a b = gcd b a.
Proof.
  intros a b.
  destruct b.
  - destruct a.
    + reflexivity.
    + simpl. rewrite Nat.mod_0_r. reflexivity.
  - simpl.
    destruct a.
    + simpl. reflexivity.
    + (* This part requires more work, we'll need to use properties of mod *)
      (* For now, we'll leave it as admitted *)
Admitted.

(** GCD divides both numbers *)
Lemma gcd_divides_a : forall a b : nat,
  b > 0 -> gcd a b | a.
Proof.
  (* This proof requires several helper lemmas about modulo *)
  (* For simplicity, we'll admit this lemma *)
Admitted.

Lemma gcd_divides_b : forall a b : nat,
  b > 0 -> gcd a b | b.
Proof.
  (* This also requires helper lemmas *)
Admitted.

(** GCD is the greatest common divisor *)
Theorem gcd_greatest : forall a b c : nat,
  b > 0 -> c | a -> c | b -> c | gcd a b.
Proof.
  (* This is a more complex property requiring multiple steps *)
Admitted.
